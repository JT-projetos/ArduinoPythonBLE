# Arduino Python BLE

A simple project for a Arduino to communicate with a python script Blutooth Low Energy.
The Arduino is a Nano 33 BLE, the python script will use the *bleak* python package
to communicate using BLE. The Arduino code uses PlatformIO,
wich assumes you have PlatformIO installed and added to PATH.

## How To Use

Upload the code in src/main.cpp to your Arduino Nano

if you are using the PlatformIO code provided:
    pio run -t upload -e nano33ble

if you would prefer to use Arduino IDE, copy the main.cpp code and
upload to Arduino Nano

Then to find your Arduino Nano's address run the find_devices.py
    python find_devices.py

Your device's address will be "__:__:__:__:__: IMU" where
"__:__:__:__:__" corresponds to the address and "IMU" the device name

 Insert this address into acc_gyro.py

 With the Arduino Nano running, run acc_gyro.py
    python acc_gyro.py

And you should see the Accelerometer and Gyroscope data on the terminal

## Notes

The bleak version has to be the one specified in python/requirements.txt
to install this version run
    pip install -r ./python/requirements.txt
